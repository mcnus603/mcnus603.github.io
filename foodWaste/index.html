				Change in New School Dining Creates Opportunities for Improving Food Waste
			</h1>
			<h2>

				Students carrying their Murray's Bagels, their Merci Market salads and their New School Cafeteria California rolls shuffle between buildings. They eat during their classes and take dinner breaks in studios, but in most of the buildings their half eaten meals will end up in the trash and heading for the landfill. <br/></br/>

				With only two of the 18 New School buildings collecting compost, there are a limited amount of places where students can dispose of food waste on campus. <br/></br/>

				However, the New School is working to better manage food waste after announcing they will bring their dining operations in house and will not be renewing their contract with the dining service Chartwells.<br/></br/>

				Andrew Smith, culinary historian and faculty in the New School's Food Studies Program said there has been pressure on universities nationwide to reduce food waste. <br/></br/>

				"There is no day that goes by without a college or university recording on a new program that they're putting on to their campuses that is trying to reduce food waste. It's a hot topic," he said. <br/></br/>

				Even New York City is trying to address the problem of waste. As part of Mayor Bill DeBlasio OneNYC initiative, he hopes to send zero waste to the landfill by 2030. A similar program exists in San Francisco where they are aiming for the same goal by 2020. <br/></br/>

				For the New School, the change in food services will give them more flexibility for managing sustainability, according to Stephen Stabile, vice president of business and finance.<br/></br/>

				"We want to be able to make a dining program that is adaptable to what students are looking for and that can be even more sustainable, all of those things that we stand for as a university," Stabile said. "Chartwells wasn't really able to do a lot of that for us. That is the bottom line."<br/></br/>

				The 45 current Chartwells workers will be offered jobs at the New School, according to a university-wide email sent on May 11. Ed Verdi, Senior Director of Business Operations, said some job descriptions will now call for data analysis skills to inform how much food the cafeteria should produce. 
<br/></br/>

				"With people handling data, we'll be able to on more granular level look at student preferences and the patterns in which things get consumed throughout the day." Verdi said. "Our first and foremost strategy is not to overproduce." <br/></br/>

				Verdi said that even under Chartwells, they've been able to keep food waste in the University Center down. <br/></br/>

				"We're quite a bit better at post consumer waste than a lot of institutions that tend to have huge volume portions or the all you can eat model, which intrinsically tends to encourage waste," Verdi said. He said that cooking the food from scratch also contributes to the UC's low food waste. <br/></br/>

				Erik Eibert, director of sustainable initiatives said he wishes the composting available in the UC, was in more buildings. <br/></br/>

				"Obviously there is compost being generated in all buildings but only picked up in two," Eibert said. "This is a decision that has been made but hasn't been revised in awhile and it probably should be with this transition." <br/></br/>

				Although the particular buildings where food waste is collected might change, how it is composted will remain the same, according to Thomas Whalen director of buildings and facilities. <br/></br/>

				"We have a pretty robust compost system," Whalen said. "The composting will operate unchanged, regardless of how [the New School] deals with food services."<br/></br/>

				The New School's current compost system includes transporting all food waste to a facility where it is converted to biogas or ethanol and fertilizer. <br/></br/>

				Smith said many experts see biogas as a sustainable solution. 
				</br/><br/>
				"Many people say that if you're trying to create a system where you're using renewable fuels, ethanol is the answer," Smith said.  "Obviously it's better not to have produced the food in the first place but if you're going to produce the food you need to explore it in new ways like biogas."
				</br/><br/>
				Although composting is a viable solution for dealing with food waste, he said it is not the first step that should be taken in food recovery. 
				</br/><br/>
				"The first thing is if it's edible food, it should go to humans. The second, which most people agree with, but not everybody, is that if it's edible why not give it to animals," Smith said. "The third and the easiest one is compost." 
				</br/><br/>
				Currently the New School composts all of their food waste and has no way to handle edible food that could be donated. 
				</br/><br/>
				The New School does have a food pantry and Andrea McFarlane, assistant director for student support and the founder of the food pantry, is excited about the dining operation change and how it could create a better collaboration between the two services. 
				</br/><br/>
				"In general we are interested in seeing what our relationship with the cafeteria with their food waste what that could look like under new management," MacFarlane said.  
				</br/><br/>
				Although the food pantry had tried to work with Chartwells before, MacFarlane said that since the food is provided by Chartwells and not the New School, it complicates things. Now that the food pantry and cafeteria operate under the New School, food would be easier to donate. 
				</br/><br/>
				"In general, as it relates back to food waste, the ability to have people hired by the New School and the ability to work with those people is greatly increased," Eibert said. "When it comes to processes with sustainability we have a lot more control. It's something that we haven't necessarily flushed out yet."
